> * require conda to manage base C libraries

## Why build a distribution package with conda ?
### Notes on spatial libraries
When a package requires libraries with **spatial functionality** such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org), it will be easier to work with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/). Such libraries depends on on open source libraries ([GEOS](https://geos.osgeo.org/), [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/), [PROJ](https://proj.org/)). As written in GeoPandas "*Those **base C libraries can sometimes be a challenge to install**. [...] So depending on your platform, you might need to compile and install their C dependencies manually. [...]. Using conda [...] avoids the need to compile the dependencies yourself.*".

> *If you want to read more about it, you may want to read the [GeoPandas installation warnings](https://geopandas.org/install.html#installation) and the [blog article on differences between conda and pip](https://www.anaconda.com/understanding-conda-and-pip/). You can also have a look on the table below (from the just quoted blog article)*

|                       | conda                   | pip                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| manages               | binaries                | wheel or source                 |
| can require compilers | no                      | yes                             |
| package types         | any                     | Python-only                     |
| create environment    | yes, built-in           | no, requires virtualenv or venv |
| **dependency checks** | **yes**                 | **no**                          |
| package sources       | Anaconda repo and cloud | PyPI                            |

Regarding these warnings and for **purposes of stability and multi-platform installations**, Conda seems to be the best option and Conda is used massively now and especially in the **data science**, machine learning and AI domains (*it includes most of useful packages such as NumPy, Pandas, ...*) and for **visualization**.

## Get & install Conda (*Miniconda*) or Anaconda:
* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) *=> minimal package*
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) *=> includes graphical interface and other tools*

## Definitions
* ***sdist***: source distribution, simple source-only .tar.gz
* ***bdist***: binary distribution => wheel. *To build and upload a distribution package*:
    ```bash
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
    ```
* different levels:
    1. .py => standalone modules
    2. sdist => pure-Python packages
    3. wheel => Python packages
    4. conda => Python + system libraries

## A quick look on different states

    ```
    ```bash
    pip install -U cookiecutter
    cookiecutter https://github.com/conda/cookiecutter-conda-python.git
    ```
* Once done, you have to adapt/set the conda recipe to your needs (*see next section*).

## Set the conda recipe
> *[Conda recipe detailed documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/concepts/recipe.html)*

"*Building a conda package requires a recipe. A conda-build recipe is a flat directory that contains the following files*:
* ***meta.yaml**---A file that contains all the metadata in the recipe. Only package/name and package/version are required*.
* ***build.sh**---The script that installs the files for the package on macOS and Linux. It is executed using the bash command (could be optional, see [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#script))*.
* ***bld.bat**---The build script that installs the files for the package on Windows. It is executed using cmd (could be optional, see [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#script)).*
* ***run_test.[py,pl,sh,bat]**---An optional Python test file, a test script that runs automatically if it is part of the recipe*.
* ***Optional patches** that are applied to the source*.
* ***Other resources** that are not included in the source and cannot be generated by the build scripts. Examples are icon files, readme files and build notes.*" (source: [Anaconda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/concepts/recipe.html))

### The meta YAML file
#### Example
```YAML
{% set name = "test" %}
{% set version = "0.7.0" %}

package:
  name: "{{ name|lower }}"
  version: "{{ version }}"

source:
  path: ..

build:
  number: 0
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . --no-deps --ignore-installed -vv "

requirements:
  host:
    - python
    - pip
  run:
    - fiona
    - pandas >=0.23.0
    - pyproj >=2.2.0
    - python
    - shapely
    - geopandas

 test:
   imports:
    - test

   license_file:
   summary: test
   doc_url:
   dev_url:

 extra:
   recipe-maintainers:

### Setup.py
> *Below is a short example, for more explanations see conda documentation and [Python packaging tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-setup-py)*

#### Example
```python
from setuptools import setup
import versioneer

setup(
    name='test',
    version=versioneer.get_version(),
    cmdclass=versioneer.get_cmdclass(),
    description="Short description",
    license="Proprietary",
    author="author",
    author_email='t',
    url='',
    packages=['test'],

    install_requires=[
		       "fiona"
		       "pandas >=0.23.0"
		       "pyproj >=2.2.0"
		       "python"
		       "shapely"
		       "geopandas"
		     ],
    keywords='test',
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8',
    ]
)
```

## Conda build
### Install conda-build
> *See [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/install-conda-build.html)*

In terminal window:
```bash
conda install conda-build
```

### Build the package
Once the recipe is done, you can build the package (*this process could take a few seconds to a few minutes regarding your package*):
* *command*:
    ```bash
    conda build --numpy [numpy version to use] --output-folder [path/to/output/folder] [path/to/recipe/folder]
    ```
* *short explanations*:
    * ```--numpy [numpy version to use]``` => numpy version to use (*optional but will use default 1.11 in case of no version given*)
    * ```--output-folder [path/to/output/folder]``` => destination folder for the built package
    * ```[path/to/recipe/folder]``` => path to conda recipe folder (*containing the ```meta.yml``` file*)
* *example*:
    ```bash
    conda build --numpy 1.17.3 --output-folder test/build/ test/conda.recipe/
    ```

### Convert the package
> *[Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/commands/conda-convert.html#conda-convert)*

You can convert your package in order to set it for the other platforms and OS:
* *command*:
    ```bash
    conda convert [path/to/tar.bz2/file]  --platform [platform] -o [path/to/output/folder]
    ```
* *short explanations*:
    * ```[path/to/tar.bz2/file]``` => path to the built package .tar.bz2 file
    * ```--platform [platform]``` => platform name (*ex: linux-32*)
    * ```-o [path/to/output/folder]``` => output folder
* *example*:
    ```bash
    conda convert test/build/linux-64/test-0.7.0-py37_0.tar.bz2  --platform win-64 -o test/build/
    ```

## Conda install
### Install from local sources
#### Directly from tarball
> ***/!\ WARNING: "Installing packages directly from the file does not resolve dependencies. If your installed package does not work, it may have missing dependencies that need to be resolved manually." ([Anaconda User Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/#installing-packages-on-a-non-networked-air-gapped-computer))***

```bash
conda install --use-local [path/to/file.tar.bz2]
```

#### By creating a conda channel
> ***Installation via this way allows to use local build package but resolve dependencies.** See the [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35605508)*

1. **Create a directory channel**:
> *Recommanded to use a tmp directory and respect the location of this directory*

* *command*:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p [path/to/new/directory/channel/arch]
    ```
* *example*:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /tmp/my-conda-channel/linux-64
    ```
2. **Copy the build file to the channel & architecture directory**:
    * *command*:
        ```bash
        cp [path/to/tar.bz2/build/file] [path/to/new/directory/channel/arch/]
        ```
    * *example*:
        ```bash
        cp test/build/linux-64/test-0.7.0-py37_0.tar.bz2 /tmp/my-conda-channel/linux-64/
        ```
3. **Conda index the channel**:
    * *command*:
        ```bash
        conda index [path/to/new/directory/channel/arch]
        ```
    * *example*:
        ```bash
        conda index /tmp/my-conda-channel/linux-64/
        ```
4. **Conda install from this channel**:
    * *command*:
        ```bash
        conda install -c file:[path/to/new/directory/channel/] [package_name]=[package_version]
        ```
    * *example*:
        ```bash
        conda install -c file://tmp/my-conda-channel/ test=0.7.0
        ```

## Developer's notes
> *This method could be compared to the creation of a virtual environment and ```pip install -e``` command*.

### Create an conda virtual environment
#### From scratch
```bash
conda create --name [your_env]
```
 #### From file
```bash
conda env create -f [path/to/env.yaml/file]
```

### Activate this environment
```bash
conda activate [name_of_the_env]
```

### Install the package (*symbolik link*)
```bash
conda develop [path_to_package]
```

### Build after changes
> *[Follow the process described in this documentation](#set_the_conda_recipe) and make the necessary changes/adaptations*
